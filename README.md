## Project vision
The project is a dynamic 2d action pvp-multiplayer platformer with lots of fast rounds. The environment in the game
is dynamic and players can interact with it.
The game is located in cyberpunk setting, and the graphic style can be described as "pixel art".
Since the game is situated in a cyberpunk setting, there are augmentations on the map for characters.
The augmentations can be picked up by the characters (augmentations is another word for "perk"). 
And the cyberpunk style is reflected in the style of the weapons, both melee and ranged.

## Project risks

 1. We won't understand how to properly get SFML to work.
    Possible solution: Switch to SDL or any other library.
 2. We won't be able to make the graphics as good as we imagined it when making the vision
    Possible solution: buy art from an artist.
 3. The networking won't work as good as we expected.
    Possible solution: consult local professionals
 4. Won't be able to escape vim
    Possible solution: turn off electricity.
